You have three structures given, struct_A,struct_B and struct_C.
struct_A has a character type element, an integer type element
and an double type element. struct_B has an integer type element and an
char type element. struct_C has an integer type element and character type element.
How are the sizes of struct_A*,struct_B* and struct_C* related?
Choose all that apply. (A = size for struct_A*, B = size for struct_B*, C = size for struct_C*)
a. A > B > C
b. A > B && A > C && B == C
c. A = B
d. B > A &&  C > A
e. A = C
f. B = C
