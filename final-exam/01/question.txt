Problem:
When printing the items from main there is a strange bit of repetition being
printed. Fix The book and media classes so only one book is printed as shown below.
Do not modify or override media's print function. Do not modify main.py.
Describe why this happened.

This happened because the "items" array was not a class variable, so when you added to items in media and book, it all added to the same items array, thus the line that inserted "Book: " to the beginning of items added to the beginning of that array every time it was called
