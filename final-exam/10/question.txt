The Superhero Class is the Base class and Batman and Superman are derived
classes (see diagram). Write the three classes, their constructors, and the
display function. The base class will have two constructors. The expected
output is shown below. Make sure everything is const-correct, virtual keyword
where needed, references, initialization lists, etc. The derived constructors
should be default and hard-coded.  The main function is provided.
