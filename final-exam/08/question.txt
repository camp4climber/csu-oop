1. Why would you want to use a template with your code? Change the declaration
   into a template and show how you would instantiate an object of that template
   for floats.

	class stack
        {
                public:
                        void           push_back( int );
                        int            size();
                        int            pop_front();
                private:
                        int            value
        }
